random-ext
==========

A library of extensions for ircmaxell/RandomLib, which can generate random numbers and strings of various strengths.

This library is for fun, and not to be used in security contexts.

Random Sources
--------------

*CSPAN*

I think that pseudo-random generators are too untrustworthy. All computer-generated random numbers cannot actually be random.
This library uses a random source that is not computer-generated. It is generated by reading bytes from a 24/7 live audio
stream of CSPAN coverage. What could be more random?

Usage
-----

```php
$generator = new \RandomLib\Generator([new \RandomExt\Source\Cspan()], new \RandomLib\Mixer\Hash());

// Generate a whole number between -100 and 100.
$randomInt = $generator->generateInt(-100, 100);

// Generate a 32 character string
$randomString = $generator->generateString(32, \RandomLib\Generator::CHAR_ALPHA);
```
